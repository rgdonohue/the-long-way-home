# Next Steps Plan: The Long Way Home

## Why this doc still exists

This file is a future-direction note, not the source of truth for current behavior. Current product behavior lives in `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, and `docs/TECH_SPEC.md`.

## Current product truth

The app is no longer a fixed-origin Capitol-only checker.

Current shipped behavior:

- the map opens centered on the configured default location in Santa Fe
- the user clicks to set an origin
- the app renders a dynamic service-area polygon for that origin
- the user clicks again to set a destination
- the app shows the shortest route, distance, duration, and a within-threshold verdict
- presets are currently `1`, `3`, and `5` miles

Already completed relative to earlier planning:

- `hotel_*` config naming was replaced with `origin_*`
- route duration is shown in the verdict panel
- threshold presets are configurable in the UI
- origin is now selected interactively in the frontend

## Product direction

The "Long Way Home" idea still makes sense as a possible next step:

> Start with the shortest route, then offer one more meaningful route based on a small amount of local context.

That remains a future product expansion, not current app behavior.

## Reasonable next steps

1. Add search inputs for origin and destination without removing the current map-click flow.
2. Decide whether the app should stay Santa Fe-focused or become city-agnostic.
3. If the product pivots toward detours, keep the current shortest-route check as the baseline comparison.
4. Add any future detour endpoint separately instead of overloading `GET /api/route`.

## Not started

- detour routing
- POI ranking
- recommendation logic
- multi-stop trips
- non-driving modes

## Practical guidance

Use the current app as the foundation. Do not rewrite the repo just to explore the "Long Way Home" direction. The existing frontend, backend, and ORS integration are already enough to support an incremental next iteration.
